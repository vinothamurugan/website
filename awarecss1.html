<p> Most malaria endemic countries in the Western Pacific Region have been very successful at reducing malaria cases and deaths over the past decade. The WHO Regional Action Framework for Malaria Control and Elimination in the Western Pacific 2016-2020 was developed to support countries on their path towards malaria elimination. As the number of malaria cases is reduced to low levels, countries will need to make a number of adjustments to their national malaria strategies. It is critical that all health workers are aware of malaria and adopt new strategies. In elimination settings where clinicians may observe only very few malaria cases, each must be aware of patient travel history to malaria endemic areas.<br>
To further raise awareness, WHO celebrates World Malaria Day each year on 25 April to underscore the collective energy and commitment of the global malaria community in uniting around the common goal of a world free of malaria.

<p><b>What is malaria and how is it transmitted?</b><br>

Malaria is a life-threatening disease primarily found in tropical countries. It is both preventable and curable. However, without prompt diagnosis and effective treatment, a case of uncomplicated malaria can progress to a severe form of the disease, which is often fatal without treatment.

Malaria is not contagious and cannot spread from one person to another; the disease is transmitted through the bites of female Anopheles mosquitoes.  Five species of parasites can cause malaria in humans and 2 of these species – Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax – pose the greatest threat. There are over 400 different species of Anopheles mosquitoes and around 40, known as vector species, can transmit the disease.

This risk of infection is higher in some areas than others depending on multiple factors, including the type of local mosquitoes. It may also vary according to the season, the risk being highest during the rainy season in tropical countries.

<p>Who is at risk of malaria?<br>

Nearly half of the world’s population is at risk of malaria. In 2022, an estimated 249 million people contracted malaria in 85 countries. That same year, the disease claimed approximately 608 000 lives.

Some people are more susceptible to developing severe malaria than others. Infants and children under 5 years of age, pregnant women and patients with HIV/AIDS are at particular risk. Other vulnerable groups include people entering areas with intense malaria transmission who have not acquired partial immunity from long exposure to the disease, or who are not taking chemopreventive therapies, such as migrants, mobile populations and travellers.  

Some people in areas where malaria is common will develop partial immunity. While it never provides complete protection, partial immunity reduces the risk that malaria infection will cause severe disease. For this reason, most malaria deaths in Africa occur in young children, whereas in areas with less transmission and low immunity, all age groups are at risk. </p><br>

Symptoms
Signs and symptoms of malaria may include:
<li>Fever</li>
<li>Chills</li>

<p>What is malaria and how is it transmitte?</p>

Malaria is a preventable disease. 
<p>1. Vector control interventions. Vector control is the main approach to prevent malaria and reduce transmission. Two forms of vector control are effective for people living in malaria-endemic countries: insecticide-treated nets, which prevent bites while people sleep and which kill mosquitoes as they try to feed, and indoor residual spraying, which is the application of an insecticide to surfaces where mosquitoes tend to rest, such as internal walls, eaves and ceilings of houses and other domestic structures. For travellers, the use of an insecticide-treated net is the most practical vector control intervention. WHO maintains a list vector control products that have been assessed for their safety, effectiveness and quality.</p>  
<p>2. Chemopreventive therapies and chemoprophylaxis. Although designed to treat patients already infected with malaria, some antimalarial medicines can also be used to prevent the disease. Current WHO-recommended malaria chemopreventive therapies for people living in endemic areas include intermittent preventive treatment of malaria in pregnancy, perennial malaria chemoprevention, seasonal malaria chemoprevention, post-discharge malaria chemoprevention, and intermittent preventive treatment of malaria for school-aged children. Chemoprophylaxis drugs are also given to travellers before entering an area where malaria is endemic and can be highly effective when combined with insecticide-treated nets. </p>
<li>General feeling of discomfort</li>
<li>Headache</li>
<li>Nausea and vomiting</li>
<li>Diarrhea</li>
<li>Abdominal pain</li>
<li>Muscle or joint pain</li>
<li>Fatigue</li>
<li>Rapid breathing</li>
<li>Rapid heart rate</li>
<li>Cough</li>
Some people who have malaria experience cycles of malaria "attacks." An attack usually starts with shivering and chills, followed by a high fever, followed by sweating and a return to normal temperature.

Malaria signs and symptoms typically begin within a few weeks after being bitten by an infected mosquito. However, some types of malaria parasites can lie dormant in your body for up to a year.
