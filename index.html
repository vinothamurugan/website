<p>What causes cancer?
The main cause of cancer is mutations, or changes to the DNA in your cells. Genetic mutations can be inherited. They can also occur after birth as a result of environmental forces.

These external causes, called carcinogens, can include:
<ul>
<li>physical carcinogens like radiation and ultraviolet (UV) light</li>
<li>chemical carcinogens like cigarette smoke, asbestos, alcohol, air pollution, and contaminated food and drinking water
biological carcinogens like viruses, bacteria, and parasites</li>
<li>According to the WHOTrusted Source, about 33 percent of cancer deaths may be caused by tobacco, alcohol, high body mass index (BMI), low fruit and vegetable consumption, and not getting enough physical activity.</li> </p>
<p>Risk factors
Certain risk factors may increase your chance of developing cancer. These risk factors can include:
<ul>
<li>tobacco use</li>
<li>high alcohol consumption</li>
<li>an unhealthy diet, characterized by red and processed meat, sugary drinks and salty snacks, starchy foods, and refined carbohydrates including sugars and processed grains, according to a 2017 review</li>
<li>a lack of physical activity</li>
<li>exposure to air pollution</li>
<li>exposure to radiation</li>
<li>unprotected exposure to UV light, such as sunlight</li>
<li>infection by certain viruses including H. pylori, human papillomavirus (HPV), hepatitis B, hepatitis C, HIV, and the Epstein-Barr <li>virus, which causes infectious mononucleosis</li>
<li>The risk of developing cancer also increases with age. In general, the risk of developing cancer appears to increase until the age of 70 to 80Trusted Source and then diminish, according to the National Cancer Institute (NCI).</li>

A 2020 reviewTrusted Source suggests this may be the result of:
<ul>
<li>less effective cell repair mechanisms that come with aging</li>
<li>buildup of risk factors over the course of life</li>
<li>duration of exposures to carcinogens</li>
<li>Some existing health conditions that cause inflammation may also increase your risk of cancer. An example is ulcerative colitis, a chronic inflammatory bowel disease.</li>


Types of cancer
Cancers are named for the area in which they begin and the type of cell they are made of, even if they spread to other parts of the body. For example, a cancer that begins in the lungs and spreads to the liver is still called lung cancer.

There are also several clinical terms used for certain general types of cancer:
<ul>
<li>Carcinoma is a cancer that starts in the skin or the tissues that line other organs.</li>
<li>Sarcoma is a cancer of connective tissues such as bones, muscles, cartilage, and blood vessels.</li>
<li>Leukemia is a cancer of the bone marrow, which creates blood cells.</li>
<li>Lymphoma and myeloma are cancers of the immune system.</li></p>
