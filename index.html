<p class="para1"><b>T</b>he results of the National Eligibility CUM Entrance Test(NEET) have just been released.The Maharastra students-Aditiya Kendre,
Shruti Veer and Paras Suryavanshi came out flying colours in the exam .The "RCC" coaching classes run by Shivraj Motegaonkar and"IIB"
classes run by Dashrath Patil have claimed that the toppers were trained in their classes.<br><br>
<b>"</b>It is unbelievable that these toppers took admissions in two classes simultaneouly.This means that
 thousands of students are being cheated and a crude game of playing with their educational 
career is being played.As such taking serious congnizance of this crime, an offense under section 420 IPC should
 be lodged against the owners of these coaching classes.
